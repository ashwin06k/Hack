Given with a .jar file.

Unzip the .jar file to get java class file, which is the object code.  Run the file on the jd-gui decompiler. 
  This gives the source code of the class file.  It has a function which XOR's two strings.
    
  The program take a single command line input. This input when multiplied by 5 should be equal to 1545686892.
  When a such an input is entered, the code passes two strings as the arguments to the XOR function.
    The XOR'd string is the flag.
