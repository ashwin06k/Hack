 On reversing the code wit r2, and working out the dissambly,
 
 The code takes command line arguments.  The code only gives a success, if the no. of command line arguments are 3.
   The code uses the three inputs as the coeffiecients of a quadratic equation.  The code calculates b^2 - 4ac.
   
   If this is equal to zero, the program prints a success message.
   If this is greater than zero, the program prints the roots of the equation.
   If this is less than zero, it pops an error message.
